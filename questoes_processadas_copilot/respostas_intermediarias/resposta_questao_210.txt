RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 210
==================================================

ENUNCIADO: In the openGauss database architecture design, what are the advantages of the primary/standby mode compared to the standalone mode?

ITENS:  
A) The recovery point objective (RPO) and the recovery time objective (RTO) can be controlled.  
B) Maximum reliability, performance, and availability can be ensured.  
C) Multiple failover and switchover modes are supported.  
D) Damaged pages can be automatically repaired.

ITEM CORRETO: A, B, C, D

EXPLICAÇÃO: In the primary/standby mode, data is synchronized between the primary and standby nodes in real time. This ensures that the RPO and RTO can be controlled. In addition, the primary/standby mode provides maximum reliability, performance, and availability. Multiple failover and switchover modes are supported. Damaged pages can be automatically repaired.
