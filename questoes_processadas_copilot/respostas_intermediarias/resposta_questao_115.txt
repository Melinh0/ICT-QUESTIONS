RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 115
==================================================

ENUNCIADO:  
18. When the sg_checkperf tool is used, which of the following items can be viewed only by the 'root' user?

ITENS:  
A) Node level  
B) Processor/Process level  
C) SSD performance  
D) OpenGauss level

ITEM CORRETO: B

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
When sg_checkperf is used, only the 'root' user can view the SSD performance. Specifically, sg_checkperf routinely checks system-level performance: Post CPU usage, GaussDB CPU usage, and I/O usage), node-level performance (CPU, memory, and I/O usage), system-level performance (SSD performance), and OpenGauss-level performance (database performance). However, to check the SSD performance, you have to use the root user.  
Therefore, the correct answer is:  
sg_checkperf -U [OUTPUT] [-SSD] [-LOGFILE]  
The '-SSD' option accesses the SSD performance check. This operation requires the 'root' user permission.  
Therefore, the answer is C.
