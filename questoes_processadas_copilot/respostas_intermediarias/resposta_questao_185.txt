RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 185
==================================================

ENUNCIADO: In addition to the query performance, indexes can be used to improve the insertion and deletion performance of the database.

ITENS:  
A) True  
B) False

ITEM CORRETO: B

EXPLICAÇÃO: Indexes are mainly used to improve the query performance of the database, but they usually have a negative impact on insert and delete operations.

Query performance:  
Indexes significantly improve query performance by providing a quick search mechanism, especially in searching, sorting, and filtering.

Insertion performance:  
During insert operation, the database not only needs to insert data in a table, but also needs to update related indexes. This means that the insert operation becomes slower because the index structure needs to be maintained and updated.

Deletion performance:  
Similarly, when data is deleted from a table, the associated indexes also need to be updated to remove the deleted data from the index. This also increases overheads of the delete operation.

Update performance:  
In indexes, update involves index columns, indexes also need to be maintained and updated, thereby affecting the performance.

In summary, indexes improve query performance, but they typically deteriorate the insert and delete performance of the database.
