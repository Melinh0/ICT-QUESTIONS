==================================================

ENUNCIADO:  
22. Which of the following is not an SSH client tool?

ITENS:  
A) ssh  
B) scp  
C) rsync  
D) sftp

ITEM CORRETO: C

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
Answer Explanations -  
rsync is not an SSH client tool.  
The other options are:  
- Option A: ssh, remote login and command execution between hosts  
- Option B: scp, secure file copy between local and remote hosts  
- Option D: sftp, secure file transfer between hosts  

While rsync can utilize SSH for secure data transfer, it is not inherently an SSH tool. It is primarily a tool focused on file transfer itself.  
rsync is a method of synchronizing files between local and remote systems by efficiently transferring only the differences between files. Its compression and recursive transfer features make it a popular choice for backups and mirroring tasks.  
Even when rsync uses SSH for secure data transfer, it remains distinct from SSH clients and protocols designed for remote login, independent of SSH.  
Therefore, C. rsync is the correct answer.
