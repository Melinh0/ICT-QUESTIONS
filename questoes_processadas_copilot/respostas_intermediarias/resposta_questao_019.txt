RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 19
==================================================

ENUNCIADO: Which of the following statements about constraints are true?

ITENS:  
A) There are column-level and table-level constraints, but OpenGauss supports only column-level constraints.  
B) Constraints can be specified only when a table is created using the CREATE TABLE statement.  
C) A PRIMARY KEY constraint is a combination of a NOT NULL constraint and a UNIQUE constraint.  
D) None of the above.

ITEM CORRETO: C

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
- Option A: This is false. Constraints can be either column-level or table-level. Column-level constraints apply only to columns, while table-level constraints apply to the entire table. OpenGauss supports both column-level and table-level constraints.  
- Option B: This is false. Constraints can be created in a table through the CREATE TABLE statement or after the table is created using the ALTER TABLE statement.  
- Option C: This is true. A PRIMARY KEY constraint ensures that the column(s) defined as the primary key must contain unique values and cannot be NULL. These are enforced using the NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints.  
- Option D: This is false, as Option C is correct.
