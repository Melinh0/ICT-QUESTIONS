RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 168
==================================================

ENUNCIADO:  
Which of the following statements about the openGauss HA enterprise deployment, RPO, and RTO is true?

ITENS:  
A) openGauss does not support HA synchronization. As a result, the RPO value is high.  
B) openGauss supports HA synchronization to ensure zero RPO and uses the ultimate RTO technology to ensure that the RTO is less than 30 seconds.  
C) openGauss supports an RPO of less than 10 seconds and zero RTO only in the HA enterprise deployment.  
D) openGauss supports an RTO of less than 10 seconds but cannot ensure zero RPO in the HA enterprise deployment.

ITEM CORRETO: B

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
- openGauss can be deployed in standalone or HA mode (one primary node and one or more standby nodes).  
- HA deployment supports synchronization between the primary and standby nodes to ensure zero RPO.  
- openGauss supports the ultimate RTO technology to ensure that services can be quickly restored within 30 seconds after a fault occurs.  
- In HA deployment, the primary and standby nodes synchronize data in real time. If the primary node fails, services are quickly switched to the standby node, ensuring zero RPO.  
- The ultimate RTO technology ensures that services can be restored within 30 seconds after a fault occurs.  
- Therefore, option B is correct.  
- Option A is incorrect because openGauss supports HA synchronization.  
- Option C is incorrect because openGauss supports zero RTO and zero RPO in HA deployment.  
- Option D is incorrect because openGauss supports zero RPO and zero RTO in HA deployment.
