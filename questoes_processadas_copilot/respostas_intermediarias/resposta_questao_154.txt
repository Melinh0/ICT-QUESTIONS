RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 154
==================================================

ENUNCIADO:  
Which of the following situations a WDR cannot be generated?

ITENS:  
A) A node restarts between two snapshots.  
B) A TRUNCATE TABLE operation is executed between two snapshots.  
C) A switch is performed between two snapshots.  
D) A DROP DATABASE operation is executed between two snapshots.

ITEM CORRETO: A, C, D

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
Upon investigation, WDRs are generated based on node restarts to diagnose and analyze database performance problems. The following analysis illustrates when a WDR cannot be generated:

A. Node restarts between two snapshots: WDRs cannot be generated if a node restarts between two snapshots. After the node restarts, the snapshot before the restart is lost, and the snapshot after the restart does not include the lost snapshot. Therefore, a WDR cannot be generated.

B. TRUNCATE TABLE operation is executed between two snapshots: Supported. The TRUNCATE TABLE operation deletes all rows in a table, but does not affect the generation of snapshots. As such, the WDR generation is not affected.

C. A switch is performed between two snapshots: WDRs cannot be generated if a switch occurs between two snapshots. After the switch, the snapshot before the switch is lost, and the snapshot after the switch does not include the lost snapshot. Therefore, a WDR cannot be generated.

D. DROP DATABASE operation is executed between two snapshots: WDRs cannot be generated if the DROP DATABASE operation deletes the entire database, which affects snapshots and prevents the generation of a WDR. Therefore, if a DROP DATABASE operation is performed between two snapshots, a WDR cannot be generated.
