==================================================

ENUNCIADO:  
6. Which of the following commands can be used to uninstall the openGauss database and delete the data directory?

ITENS:  
A) gs_uninstall  
B) gs_preinstall  
C) gs_uninstall --delete-data  
D) gs_postinstall  

ITEM CORRETO: C

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
This command can start the uninstallation process, but does not specify the option to delete the data directory.  
This command is used to prepare the cluster environment and is irrelevant to the uninstallation of openGauss.  
This command can uninstall openGauss and delete the data directory: gs_uninstall --delete-data deletes the data directory. This is the correct command for uninstalling openGauss and deleting the data directory.  
This command is used to perform post-installation operations after openGauss database is uninstalled. It does not uninstall the openGauss database or directly delete the data directory.  
In conclusion, the answer is C.
