RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 280
==================================================

ENUNCIADO:  
Which of the following statements about the "free -m" command is true?

ITENS:  
A) In the output, the unit is MB.  
B) In the output, the unit is KB.  
C) This command is used to check the free drive space.  
D) This command is used to check the free CPUs.

ITEM CORRETO: A

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
Option A: This is the true statement. "free -m" is used to display the usage of the physical memory and swap memory in the Linux system. The "-m" option is a common option that makes the output of the "free" command in MB (megabytes).  
Option B: This is incorrect. Although the "free" command may be run by itself as (kb) kilobytes, the built-in option "-m" makes the output in MB.  
Option C: This is incorrect. "free -m" is used to view the usage of the system memory (RAM) and swap space, showing sizes related to drive space. To check free drive space, use the "df" command.  
Option D: This is incorrect. This answer is not related to the "free" command. It is used to check the concept of space. Therefore, to check the free/available CPU space, use the "vm" CPU usage, or "top", "htop", "vmstat", or "mpstat".
