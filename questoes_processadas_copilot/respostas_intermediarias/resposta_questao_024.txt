RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 24
==================================================

ENUNCIADO: A system catalog stores openGauss metadata and is the core part of a database. Users cannot manually edit the system catalog data.

ITENS:  
A) True  
B) False

ITEM CORRETO: A

EXPLICAÇÃO: System catalogs store structured metadata of openGauss. They are the source of information used by openGauss to control system running and are a core part of the database system. System catalogs, also called data dictionaries, store definitions of database objects; openGauss manages multiple database instances. In these instances, system catalogs are classified into instance-level and database-level system catalogs.  
In normal cases, system catalogs or system views must not be manually modified by users. The system catalog information is automatically maintained by SQL-related system operations during database running. In special scenarios, some system catalogs can be modified by users, but it is advised not to modify them.
