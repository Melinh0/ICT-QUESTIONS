RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 272
==================================================

ENUNCIADO:  
Which of the following statements are true about the openGauss database?

ITENS:  
A) OM, the cluster management module, provides cluster startup and stop, primary/standby switchover, and status query.  
B) CM, the OM management module, provides management APIs and tools for routine database O&M and configuration management.  
C) Client driver receives the access requests from applications and returns the execution results to the applications.  
D) openGauss primarily stores structured service data (for example, two-table joins, column-store tables, or MTONs), executes data query tasks, and returns execution results to the client driver.  
E) The client driver receives the access requests from applications and returns the execution results to the applications.

ITEM CORRETO: C D

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
The correct answers are explained as follows:  
- Option A is incorrect. The OM management module provides management APIs and tools for routine database O&M and configuration management. The Cluster Manager (CM) module of the OM management module provides cluster startup and stop, primary/standby switchover, and status query.  
- Option B is incorrect. The CM module provides cluster startup and stop, primary/standby switchover, and status query. OM is the O&M management module.  
- Option C is correct. The client driver receives the access requests from applications and returns the execution results to applications.  
- Option D is correct. openGauss primarily stores structured service data (for example, two-table joins, column-store tables, or MTONs), executes data query tasks, and returns execution results to the client driver.  
- Option E is incorrect. The client driver receives the access requests from applications and returns the execution results to applications. However, it is the same as Option C. In multiple-answer questions, the same option cannot be selected repeatedly.
