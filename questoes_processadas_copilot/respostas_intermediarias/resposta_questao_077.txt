RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 77
==================================================

ENUNCIADO: In the openGauss database, which of the following sets of operators is usually used as scan nodes?

ITENS:  
A) HashJoin, MergeJoin, and NestLoopJoin  
B) Limit, Offset, and Sort  
C) SeqScan, IndexScan, and SubQueryScan  
D) Aggregate, Group, and Distinct  

ITEM CORRETO: C

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
Answer Explanations:  
- They are join operators used to process table associations. Although they play a key role in a query, they are usually not seen as simply "scan nodes". These operators involve join operations between tables, rather than directly scanning existing data from tables or indexes.  
- These operators are used to process table associations.  
- These operators comply with the definition of "scan nodes":  
  - SeqScan: This operator scans all data in a table. It is implemented based on the physical storage sequence of data in the table.  
  - IndexScan: This operator scans data based on indexes. It is implemented based on the physical storage sequence of indexes.  
  - SubQueryScan: This operator processes scan operations in subqueries.  
- These operators are used to access data from tables directly. They are located after the scan section as the access nodes to process data from tables and indexes.
