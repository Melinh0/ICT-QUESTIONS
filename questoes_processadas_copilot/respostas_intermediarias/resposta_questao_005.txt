ENUNCIADO:  
86. The rwx mechanism of Linux controls file access permissions.

ITENS:  
A) True  
B) False

ITEM CORRETO: A

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
In the Linux operating system, file permissions determine which users or user groups can read (r), write (w), and execute (x) operations on a file. These permissions are usually represented by symbols (rwx) or numbers (421).  
1. The read permission (r) allows the file content to be read. If you have the read permission on a directory, you can see the list of subdirectories in the directory.  
2. The write permission (w) allows the content to be modified. If you have the write permission on a directory, you can create files in or delete files from the directory.  
3. The execute permission (x) allows the file to be executed as a program. If you have the execute permission on a directory, you can access the directory (that is, the 'cd' command to access the directory).  
File permissions are classified into three groups. Each group contains three types of permissions (rwx) for the owner, group, and others, respectively. For example: "rwx---x--" indicates that the owner has full access, the group has no access, and others have only execute permission (they may not read the permission).
