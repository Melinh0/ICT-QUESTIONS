ITENS:  
A) True  
B) False

ITEM CORRETO: A

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
The Vim (Vi IMproved) editor is indeed a more powerful text editor developed from the vi editor. Vim was launched by Bram Moolenaar in 1991 as an improvement and extension of vi.

- Normal mode: In this mode, you can move the cursor, copy lines, and access frequently-used text operations.  
- Insert mode: In this mode, you press shortcut keys to input, paste text, and enter edit mode.  
- Insert mode: This mode lets you insert and edit text. You enter insert mode from normal mode by pressing 'i' or other designated keys.  
- Command-line mode: This mode lets you perform editor commands like save the file, delete text, and search and replace text. It is typically accessed by typing ':' in normal mode.

Therefore, the statement in the question is true.
