RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 304
==================================================

ENUNCIADO:  
Which of the following statements about x2openEuler are true?

ITENS:  
A) The migration tool for openEuler is x2openEuler.  
B) The x2openEuler architecture consists of the server and the node to be upgraded.  
C) x2openEuler supports simultaneous OS upgrade of 1,000 hosts.  
D) x2openEuler supports in-place migration.

ITEM CORRETO: A, B, C, D

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
- A: True. x2openEuler is indeed a migration tool for migrating a source OS to openEuler.  
- B: True. x2openEuler consists of a server and a client. The server refers to the machine where x2openEuler is installed, and the client is the machine running the OS that requires kernel upgrade. That is, the node to be upgraded.  
- C: True. x2openEuler is capable of upgrading 1,000 hosts simultaneously.  
- D: True. The core function of x2openEuler is in-place migration. In the context of x2openEuler, in-place migration means that the OS is upgraded to another version or migrated to another OS while preserving the user data, configurations, and applications.
