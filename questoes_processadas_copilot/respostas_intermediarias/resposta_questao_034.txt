13. Which of the following commands can be used to view the background tasks of the current shell?

ITENS:  
A) cat  
B) vim  
C) jobs  
D) bg

ITEM CORRETO: C

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
Answer Explanations:  
- Option 'A' is incorrect as the 'cat' command reads the background processes of the current terminal session or shell.  
- After starting a command or program in a terminal or shell, you can press 'Ctrl+Z' to pause it and move it to the background. You can then run 'jobs' to view the list of background tasks.  
- Option 'B' is used to concatenate or display file content and is not related to background tasks.  
- Option 'C' is the correct answer but did not select it leading to incorrect answer.  
- Option 'D' is used to resume a job that was paused and moved to the background.  
- The 'jobs' command displays a list of background tasks, including their job IDs, status (running or stopped), and associated commands. This information allows you to decide whether to resume a background task using the 'fg' command or terminate it using the 'kill' command.  
- The correct answer is 'C'. The 'jobs' command is the most suitable option for viewing background tasks of the current shell, as it provides a reliable tool for managing and controlling these background processes.
