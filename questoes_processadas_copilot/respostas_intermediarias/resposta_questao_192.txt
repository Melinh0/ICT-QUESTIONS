RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 192
==================================================

ENUNCIADO:  
79. When you access the Samba directory through "\\tsamba_IP\share", login authentication is not required, but you can only create folders or files.

ITENS:  
A) True  
B) False

ITEM CORRETO: B

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
1. Login authentication is required if it depends on the Samba configuration. You can set the permissions as "shared" or "user" and set the "guest ok = yes" and "security = share". You can access shared directories without logging in.  
2. You can only create folders or files. This also depends on the Samba configuration. You can set the permissions on shared directories as follows (for example in the smb.conf file): "access = yes" "writable=both" "create mask=0777", which allows users to read and create folders or files. For example, if "writable = yes", users can read and write, depending on the configured permissions.  
3. When you access the Samba directory, you can create folders or files if permissions are set accordingly, depending on the configured permissions.

More specifically:  
- Whether login authentication is required depends on the Samba configuration (you may or may not need to perform login authentication).  
- You can still create folders or files depending on the permissions and directives on the Samba configuration (not only limited to folder creation, also allowed to perform other operations).
