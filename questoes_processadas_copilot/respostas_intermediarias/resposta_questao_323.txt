RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 323
==================================================

ENUNCIADO:  
7. Which of the following is the fully-encrypted equality query capability provided by openGauss?

ITENS:  
A) Data is encrypted during storage and decrypted during computing.  
B) Data is encrypted during storage and computing and decrypted when it is returned to the client.  
C) Data is encrypted during transmission, storage, and computing and cannot be decrypted.  
D) Data is encrypted during storage and decrypted using the dynamic key provided by the application during computing.

ITEM CORRETO: C

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
Option C is correct. The fully-encrypted equality query capability provided by openGauss ensures that data is encrypted during transmission, storage, and computing and cannot be decrypted. This guarantees data security throughout the entire lifecycle.  
Option A is incorrect because it only encrypts data during storage.  
Option B is incorrect because it decrypts data when returned to the client, which may pose a security risk.  
Option D is incorrect because it relies on a dynamic key provided by the application, which may not be secure enough.
