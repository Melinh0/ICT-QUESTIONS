EXPLICAÇÃO:  
Answer Explanation:  
In the permissions of a file in Linux, the third part is permissions of the group to which the file owner belongs. The permissions on a file are presented in the following order:  
1. File type  
2. Permissions of the file owner  
3. Permissions of the group to which the file owner belongs  
4. Permissions of other users  

A file's permissions are typically represented by a 10-bit value, each bit representing the read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions of the file owner, group, and others.  

Option A is incorrect. File type is the first part of the permissions.  
Option B is incorrect. Permissions of the file owner is the second part.  
Option D is incorrect. Permissions of other users is the fourth part.  
Option C is correct. Permissions of the group to which the file owner belongs is the third part. Understanding the order helps properly identify each component of the file permissions.
