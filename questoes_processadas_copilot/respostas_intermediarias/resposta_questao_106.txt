RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 106
==================================================

ENUNCIADO: Currently, the SERIAL column can be specified when you create a table and it can be inserted into an existing table.

ITENS:  
A) True  
B) False

ITEM CORRETO: B

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
Answer Explanation:  
This is false.  
In openGauss, similar to other database management systems (such as PostgreSQL), the SERIAL type is a special column type used to automatically create a unique identifier (usually an integer) and can be automatically incremented. However, this special column type is used to define auto-increment columns in PostgreSQL.  
In PostgreSQL, you can use SERIAL, BIGSERIAL, or SMALLSERIAL to define auto-increment columns. The column is created in 'example_table'. This column automatically increments and can be used as the primary key.  
However, in openGauss, there is no such support for the SERIAL type. Therefore, you cannot use SERIAL to define auto-increment columns when creating a table and cannot use the SERIAL column type in an existing table.
