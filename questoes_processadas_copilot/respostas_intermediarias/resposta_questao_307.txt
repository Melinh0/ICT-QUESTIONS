RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 307
==================================================

ENUNCIADO:  
25. Which of the following is NOT a function of the connection pool?

ITENS:  
A) To connect to a database.  
B) To optimize the database connection.  
C) To share connections with different attributes.  
D) To optimize clients.

ITEM CORRETO: D

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
Option A: This is a function of the connection pool. Connection pooling is a technique for reusing and managing buffer pools of database connections that are ready to be used by any thread that needs them.  
Option B: This is a function of the connection pool. The connection pool mechanism reduces the number of externalized statements and distributed files, improves the database connection pool, and improves the database connection speed.  
Option C: This is a function of a thread linked to the connection pool. Each thread can provide a connection with different attributes such as time zone, language, and security, and is usually created for a specific database connection configuration. Although some connection pools also allow for a certain degree of flexibility, "share connections with different attributes" is more often used in general-purpose functions of connection pools.  
Option D: This is not a function of the connection pool. The connection pool is a technique for optimizing the database connection. It does not optimize clients. The connection pool does not directly optimize clients, even though clients benefit from the reduced connection time.  
Therefore, the correct answer to the question is D. To optimize clients.
