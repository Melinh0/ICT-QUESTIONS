==================================================

ENUNCIADO:  
51. The "mount" command can be used only to mount a file system. It cannot be used to view the mounting status.

ITENS:  
A) True  
B) False

ITEM CORRETO: B

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
Answer : False

Answer Explanation:  
The "mount" command can be used to mount file systems and view mounted file systems.  
1. Mounting file systems: The "mount" command is used to mount a device or file system to a mount point, for example: mount /dev/sda1 /mnt.  
2. Viewing mounted file systems: If "mount" is executed without any options or parameters, it lists all mounted file systems, including their device name, mount point, type, mount options.  
3. The "mount" command can also be used to mount file systems over a network. It is a common tool for file system management.

Some common "mount" command usages:  
- "mount" : mounts all file systems specified in "/etc/fstab".  
- "mount /dev/sda1 /mnt" : mounts the specified device to the mount point.  
- "mount -o options" : specifies mount options.  
- "mount -t type" : specifies the file system type.

Therefore, the statement in the question is false. The "mount" command has both functions.
