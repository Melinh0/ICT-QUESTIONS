RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 234
==================================================

ENUNCIADO: Which of the following steps need to be performed during openGauss installation?

ITENS:  
A) Disable transparent huge pages.  
B) Disable the firewall.  
C) Disable the swap memory.  
D) Unify the time zone and time.

ITEM CORRETO: ABCD

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
- Option A: Transparent Huge Pages (THP) may affect the performance of the database. Therefore, you need to disable it before installing openGauss.  
- Option B: The firewall can block network connections of the database. Turning off the firewall can avoid network communication problems during installation and configuration.  
- Option C: To ensure the performance and stability of the database service, swap memory is usually disabled or set to a recommended value.  
- Option D: Ensure that the time zone and time are correct. This is especially important for the database system because the timestamp plays a role in the time. If the time is different from the current time, you can copy the corresponding time zone file to the /etc/localtime directory and set the time zone.
