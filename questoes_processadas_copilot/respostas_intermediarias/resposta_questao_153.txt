RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 153
==================================================

ENUNCIADO:  
10. Which of the following tools is used to check whether the environment meets the installation requirements before openGauss installation?

ITENS:  
A) gs_checks  
B) gs_check  
C) gs_checkperf  
D) gs_collector

ITEM CORRETO: B

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
Answer Explanation:  
To check the environment, you need to use a dedicated tool to check the environment to ensure that the OS environment and configuration are proper. gs_check is used to check the OS. It provides the following functions:

Checking the OS version: Ensures that the OS version is compatible with openGauss.

Checking kernel parameters: Checks kernel parameters to ensure that the performance and stability of the OS are ensured. This check verifies that kernel parameters are set properly.

Checking the OS configuration: Checks whether the OS configuration is correct and satisfies the requirements of openGauss installation. This check verifies that the disk space is sufficient and whether the I/O configuration is optimal.

Checking network configuration: A database requires stable network configuration. This check verifies the network configuration to ensure that the network is stable and the timeout interval is proper.

Therefore, gs_check is the correct answer. Although other tools such as gs_check, gs_checkperf, and gs_collector are also provided by openGauss, they are not as direct and comprehensive as gs_check in checking the environment before installation.
