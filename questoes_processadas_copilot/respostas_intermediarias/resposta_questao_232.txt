RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 232
==================================================

ENUNCIADO:  
Which of the following commands can be used to query the list of files provided by a software package?

ITENS:  
A) rpm -Uvh <package_name>  
B) rpm -iKh <package_name>  
C) rpm -ql <package_name>  
D) rpm -qf <package_name>

ITEM CORRETO: C

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
This command attempts to upgrade a package to the latest version, but does not actually perform the installation or upgrade operation. This is because the "-U" option is used to display the installation progress. Without the "-i" or "-U" option, the command will execute the operation when used with rpm. It is often used in conjunction with the list option.

The "-i" option is used to install the package, and the "-K" option is used to verify the package. The "-q" option indicates installation, the "-l" option indicates the list of files, and the "-f" option displays the installation progress.

The correct command is:  
rpm -ql <package_name>  

This command lists all files installed by the specified software package "<package_name>".

In this command, the "-q" option is used to query the package, and the "-l" option is used to list all files in a software package, to verify every software package to which a file belongs.

The command lists all files in the package.
