RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 256
==================================================

ENUNCIADO: The result of SELECT CIRCLE '(0, 0), 1' << CIRCLE '(5,0), 1'; is TRUE.

ITENS:  
A) True  
B) False

ITEM CORRETO: A

EXPLICAÇÃO: This question is about the geometric operator << in the openGauss database. In openGauss, << is an operator that determines whether a geometric object is completely inside another geometric object. According to the expression in the question, assume that the two CIRCLEs are A and B, their centers are (0,0) and (5,0), and their radiuses are 1. Because the center of A is on the right of B, A is completely inside B. Therefore, the expression returns TRUE.
