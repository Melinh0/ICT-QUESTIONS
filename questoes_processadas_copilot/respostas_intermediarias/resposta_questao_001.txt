RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 1
==================================================

ENUNCIADO: Q32. Which of the following scenarios is most suitable for distributed striped volumes of GlusterFS?

ITENS:  
A) Scenario that involves a great number of large files and requires high read and write performance.  
B) Scenario that involves a great number of large files and requires high read performance and reliability.  
C) Scenario that requires flexible data access control.  
D) Scenario that requires fast data recovery.

ITEM CORRETO: A

EXPLICAÇÃO: In GlusterFS distributed striped volumes, multiple files are stored on multiple nodes in hash-based order, and each file is striped and stored on multiple bricks. These volumes inherit the advantages of distributed volumes and striped volumes and provide high read/write performance. However, they do not offer data redundancy, fault tolerance, or flexible data access control.

The detailed analysis is as follows:  
Option A describes the scenario that involves a great number of large files and requires high read and write performance.  
Option B describes the scenario that involves a great number of large files and requires high read performance and reliability, but does not meet application scenarios of distributed striped volumes.  
Option C describes the scenario that requires flexible data access control, which is not suitable for distributed striped volumes.  
Option D describes the scenario that requires fast data recovery, which is not suitable for the efficient and fast read/write application scenario of distributed striped volumes.
