RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 258
==================================================

ENUNCIADO:  
7. When the gs_checkperf tool is used to check system performance, which of the following can be viewed only by user root?

ITENS:  
A) openGauss level  
B) Host level  
C) Session-Process level  
D) SSD performance

ITEM CORRETO: D

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
The gs_checkperf tool checks CPU usage, openGauss CPU usage, and I/O usage. However, not all information is available to non-root users.  
Host level is similar to openGauss level and includes checks of CPU, memory, and I/O usage, but not all are available to non-root users.  
Session-Process level checks openGauss session and process information, and is not only available to the root user.  
SSD performance checks are restricted to the root user due to permission issues in some systems.  
Therefore, the correct answer is D. SSD performance.
