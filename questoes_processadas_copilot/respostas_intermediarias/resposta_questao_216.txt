RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 216
==================================================

ENUNCIADO:  
Which of the following statements about the procedure for the SQL engine to execute SQL statements are true?

ITENS:  
A) Syntax & lexical parsing: converts the formatted structure into objects that can be recognized by the database.  
B) Query rewriting: converts the formatted structure into an internal representation that is usable for query execution.  
C) Query optimization: plans the execution mode of SQL statements (that is, the execution plan) based on the output of query rewriting and the internal database statistics.  
D) Query execution: executes SQL query statements based on the execution path planned in query optimization.

ITEM CORRETO: A, C, D

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
- Syntax & lexical parsing converts SQL statements into abstract syntax trees (ASTs) or other internal representations.  
- Query rewriting modifies the query to optimize performance but does not convert the formatted structure into an internal representation.  
- Query optimization plans the execution mode using internal database statistics.  
- Query execution executes SQL statements based on the execution path planned in query optimization.
