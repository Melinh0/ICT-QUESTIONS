==================================================

ENUNCIADO: Which of the following statements about openGauss logs are true?

ITENS:  
A) System logs include those generated by database nodes when openGauss is running and those generated when openGauss is deployed.  
B) Operation logs are generated when database tools are used by a database administrator or user.  
C) Performance logs are primarily concerned with monitoring the access efficiency of internal resources.  
D) After the audit function is enabled, many audit logs will be generated, which occupy a large storage space.

ITEM CORRETO: ABD

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
This is true. System logs include logs generated by the database node when openGauss is running and logs generated during openGauss installation and deployment. These logs are important for determining the cause of a fault and formulating a recovery method when the database does not work properly.  

This is true. Operation logs record the operations performed on the database by database administrators or users. For example, you can use database tools to back up your operations on the database and reproduce the fault based on the operation records.  

This is incorrect. Performance logs are used to monitor the status of physical resources and the performance of internal resources. Performance logs are used to monitor the status of physical resources and the performance of internal resources. You can use performance logs to determine whether the database system is properly running and locate faults when troubleshooting is difficult.  

This is true. After the audit function is enabled, many audit logs will be generated, which occupy a large storage space. You can customize an audit policy based on your needs to reduce the number of audit logs and save storage space.  

Therefore, the answers are A, B, and D.
