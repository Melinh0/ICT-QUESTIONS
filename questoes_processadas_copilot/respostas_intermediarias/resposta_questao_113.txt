ITEM CORRETO: A B C D

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
In the OpenELEC system (and other Linux-based systems), when you log in to the system using the CLI or SSH, the shell loads a series of configuration files based on different conditions.  
The shell (sh-type) might load the following files:  
- '/etc/profile' (system file)  
- '~/.profile' (user-specific file)  
- '~/.bash_profile' (user-specific file)  
The shell will not or might not load the following files:  
- '~/.bashrc' (normally loaded through '~/.bash_profile' if used by the user)
