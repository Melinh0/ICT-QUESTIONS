RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 291
==================================================

ENUNCIADO: 08. In openEuler, the niceness value of a process ranges from -20 to +20.

ITENS:  
A) True  
B) False

ITEM CORRETO: B

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
Answer Explanations:  
In openEuler and most Linux systems, the niceness value of a process ranges from -20 (high) to +19 (low), not from -20 to +20. The niceness value affects the process priority. A smaller value indicates a higher priority and a higher probability that the process is scheduled and executed by the CPU. In Linux, a positive niceness value indicates a lower priority, and a negative niceness value indicates a higher priority. The niceness value of a process ranges from -20 (highest priority) to +19 (lowest priority).
