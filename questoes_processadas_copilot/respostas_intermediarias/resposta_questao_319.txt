ITEM CORRETO: D

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
Answer Explanation:  
In a Linux OS, the permission value is the usually consists of three digits, representing the permissions of the file owner, user groups, and others (users outside the owner group) from left to right.  

Each digit is a sum. The meanings are as follows:  
- 7 = 4 (read) + 2 (write) + 1 (execute)  
- 6 = 4 (read) + 2 (write)  
- 4 = 4 (read)  

So, 764 means:  
- The file owner has permission 7 (read, write, and execute),  
- The user group of the file owner has permission 6 (read and write),  
- Others have permission 4 (read).  

Therefore, the correct permission value is 764.
