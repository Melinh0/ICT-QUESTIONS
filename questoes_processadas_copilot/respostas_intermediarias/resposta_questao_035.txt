RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 35
==================================================

ENUNCIADO:  
21. Which of the following tools is used to help users understand the database workload of openGauss?

ITENS:  
A) gs_checkos  
B) gs_check  
C) gs_checkperf  
D) gs_collector  

ITEM CORRETO: C

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
gs_checkos: provides multiple tools to help users manage and maintain databases.  
gs_check: is used to check the OS, control parameters, and disk configurations. It does not directly check the workload of openGauss.  
gs_checkperf: is a comprehensive check tool used to check multiple environment parameters and configurations during the time of installing openGauss. It does not focus on workload monitoring.  
gs_collector: is a tool used to collect and extract data from multiple nodes. Although it monitors the I/O and CPU usage, helping users understand the database workload, gs_checkperf is the highly reliable tool for that.
