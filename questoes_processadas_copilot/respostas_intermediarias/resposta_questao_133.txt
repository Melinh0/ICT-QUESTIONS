RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 133
==================================================

ENUNCIADO: In the configuration of the connection authentication rule, if the authentication rule of the same host has two different configurations, the later configuration overwrites the previous one.

ITENS:  
A) True  
B) False

ITEM CORRETO: B

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
Answer Explanations:  
1. In the configuration of the connection authentication rule, if the authentication rule of the same host has two different configurations, the later configuration overwrites the previous one." In this sentence, "the later configuration overwrites the previous one" is not necessarily correct, because it also depends on the specific configuration system, software, or database management system.  
2. Configuration precedence may differ: Multiple configuration rules may coexist in many systems. These precedence rules may be processed based on certain rules or times. For example, some configurations may have higher priority than others.  
3. Configuration syntax and context: The configuration rule definition also depends on the syntax and context. Even if two rules seem to be the same, they may have different effects due to context differences (such as syntax scope, or conditions).  
4. Configuration version and conditions: If two configuration rules have different versions, these default settings may conflict with each user host and software configurations.  
5. Troubleshooting is also common, as changes in configuration rules may cause system errors or unexpected behaviors. Therefore, when applying configuration rules, always verify the specific environment and configuration context.  
6. In implementation, software and hardware systems also depend on factors such as the specific system implementation, configuration context, and context. Therefore, the answer is "False."
