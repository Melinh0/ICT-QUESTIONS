RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 145
==================================================

ENUNCIADO:  
17. Which of the following is not a table of iptables?

ITENS:  
A) filter  
B) nat  
C) mangle  
D) INPUT

ITEM CORRETO: D

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
"INPUT" is not a table of iptables. iptables is a firewall utility in Linux used to manage network packet filtering and Network Address Translation (NAT) rules. It mainly operates on the following tables:  
- "filter": The main table to create firewall rules.  
- "nat": Used to create NAT rules for DNAT operations, including source NAT (SNAT) and destination NAT (DNAT).  
- "mangle": The "mangle" table is used to alter packets.  
- "raw": The "raw" table is used to disable connection tracking.  
"INPUT", "OUTPUT", and "FORWARD" are not tables but chains defined within the tables. These chains are used for packets in different scenarios:  
- "INPUT" is used for incoming packets to the host.  
- "OUTPUT" is used for outgoing packets from the host.  
- "FORWARD" is used for packets that are forwarded through the host.  
In iptables, rules are defined in chains of a table. INPUT is an important chain defined in the "filter" table. Therefore, the correct answer is D.  
These tables have chains that are used to process and filter network traffic. The proper context is crucial to network security in Linux.
