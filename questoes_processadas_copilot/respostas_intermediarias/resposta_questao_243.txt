RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 243
==================================================

ENUNCIADO:  
40. In a typical LVS cluster, which of the following modes support the front-end server (FS)?

ITENS:  
A) VRF  
B) DR  
C) PR  
D) NF  

ITEM CORRETO: BCD

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
VRF is not a standard mode of LVS clusters and is not directly related to the front-end server.  
DR (Direct Routing) mode allows the front-end server to schedule requests and forward them to real servers.  
PR (IP Tunneling) mode enables the front-end server to schedule requests and forward them to real servers using IP tunneling.  
NF (Network Address Translation) mode allows the front-end server to schedule requests and forward them to real servers using NAT.  
LVS clusters use persistent connections and client requests are handled differently depending on the mode used.
