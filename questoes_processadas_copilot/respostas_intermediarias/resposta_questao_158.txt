EXPLICAÇÃO:  
Sorry, your answer was wrong. My Score: 0 Point(s) Answer: ACD

Answer Explanations:  
- Option (A): This statement is incorrect. 'chgrp' does not set directory creation file permissions. It can indirectly change file permissions by changing the group to which a file belongs. 'chmod' is used to configure file permissions.  
- Option (B): This statement is correct. 'chgrp' is used to change the group to which a file or directory belongs.  
- Option (C): This statement is incorrect. The 'chown' command is used to change the owner of a file, not the 'chgrp' command.  
- Option (D): This statement is incorrect. The 'umask' command is used to configure the user file-creation mode mask. It is not related to the 'chgrp' command.
