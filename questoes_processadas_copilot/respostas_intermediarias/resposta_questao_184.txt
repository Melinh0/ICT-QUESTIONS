ITEM CORRETO: C

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
Answer Explanations:  
- Row-level security policies can be applied to SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE operations and cannot be applied to INSERT and MERGE operations.  
- This is true. Row-level security policies cannot be defined on views.  
- This is false. Row-level security policies affect both the initial user and system administrators.  
- This is true. If a dynamic data masking policy is configured for a table with row-level security policies defined, grant the permissions of triggers. However, it is not advised to directly grant the permissions of the table to other users, but it is a reasonable suggestion for permission and policy configuration. Although the suggestion is not directly related to the row-level security policy, it is about how to use the features in a secure manner.
