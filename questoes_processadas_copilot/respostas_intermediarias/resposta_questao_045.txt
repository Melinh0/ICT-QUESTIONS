Answer Explanations:  
- Option A is incorrect. '/etc/fstab' is not automatically generated by the system. Instead, it is configured by the system administrator so that file systems can be mounted during startup.  
- Option B is correct. '/etc/fstab' is not used to store system information. System information refers to the system's hardware or software automatically during startup. This includes device names, mount points, file systems, mount types, and mount options.  
- Option C is incorrect. '/etc/fstab' is not related to file naming rules, which are determined by the file system and the operating system, and have nothing to do with '/etc/fstab'.  
- Option D is incorrect. Hardware information is stored in other configuration files, such as files in '/etc/defaults' and '/etc/sysconfig', as well as files in '/proc' and '/sys'.
