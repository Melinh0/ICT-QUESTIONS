RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 62
==================================================

ENUNCIADO:  
23. After an application is started in openEuler, which of the following commands can be used to set a priority for the corresponding process?

ITENS:  
A) priority  
B) nice  
C) renice  
D) setpri  

ITEM CORRETO: B

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
The "priority" command does not exist in openEuler.  
The "nice" command can be used to change the priority of a running process, not set the initial priority of a newly started process.  
The "renice" command can be used to change the priority of an already running process.  
Note: The "nice" command can only be used to increase the priority (unless executed with root privileges). This is a security measure to prevent regular users from affecting the operation of critical system processes.
