ENUNCIADO:  
30. Which of the following table clearance operations support transaction rollback?

ITENS:  
A) TRUNCATE  
B) DROP  
C) DELETE  
D) VACUUM

ITEM CORRETO: C

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
On transaction operations, transaction rollback is not necessarily supported among different table clearance operations.  
Option A: In MySQL, TRUNCATE is a DDL operation that does not support transaction rollback. However, in PostgreSQL, a transaction can be rolled back after the TRUNCATE operation.  
Option B: DROP TABLE is considered a DDL operation and does not support transaction rollback in most databases.  
Option C: The DELETE statement is used to delete rows and meets specific conditions to roll back in time. It supports transaction rollback in most databases.  
Option D: VACUUM is used to reclaim storage and is not a table clearance operation that supports transaction rollback.
