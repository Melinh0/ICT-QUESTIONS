RESPOSTA DA QUESTÃO 147
==================================================

ENUNCIADO:  
87. If you specify the PARTITION parameter when running the CREATE TABLE statement, the table will be partitioned.

ITENS:  
A) True  
B) False

ITEM CORRETO: A

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
In a database management system, partitioning is a technique that divides the data of a table into smaller, manageable parts. This can improve query performance and management efficiency. In openGauss, you can use the 'PARTITION' parameter to enable partitioning when creating a table.

The benefits of partitioning include:  
- Performance optimization: Query insert, delete, and update operations can be faster because these operations only need to be performed on related partitions rather than the entire table.  
- Management efficiency: Improved management operations, such as backup and restoration, can be performed more efficiently.  
- Data archiving: Old data can be moved to cheaper storage devices, saving costs and increasing performance.  
Therefore, adding the 'PARTITION' parameter to the CREATE TABLE statement indicates that the partitioning function is applied to the table.
