C) If a temporary table is used, delete the temporary table before you return the connection to the connection pool.

ITEM CORRETO: C

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
Sorry, your answer was wrong. My Score: 0 Point(s) Answer: C(D)  
- Option A: Restarting the application is not a good solution as it does not help with user database authorization switches or potential issues related to temporary tables.  
- Option B: Using "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION DEFAULT;RESET ALL;" is not a common method and may not be effective in all cases.  
- Option C: Deleting the temporary table before returning the connection to the pool is a reliable method to ensure the connection status is cleared.
