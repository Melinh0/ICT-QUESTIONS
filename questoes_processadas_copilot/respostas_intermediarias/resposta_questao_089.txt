ENUNCIADO:  
14. When creating a user in openEuler, which of the following options can be used to specify the home directory for the user?

ITENS:  
A) -d  
B) -g  
C) -r  
D) -e

ITEM CORRETO: A

EXPLICAÇÃO:  
Answer Explanation:  
When a user is created in openEuler, the '-d' option is used to specify the home directory.  
The '-d' option is common and the standard command for creating a user in Linux with various options for configuring user attributes, including the '-d' and '--home-dir' options that explicitly specify the home directory for the new user.

--home=<homebase> newuser  
This command creates a new user and sets the home directory to '/home/newuser'. If the '-d' option is not specified, 'newuser' will create a home directory for the new user based on the system-wide default home base path (usually '/home').

Option '-g' specifies the user's initial group.  
Option '-r' creates a system user.  
Option '-e' adds a delete expiration time for the user.

Therefore, the correct answer is A.
